# ZooBurst
A simple bejeweled clone in C#.
You'll need .NET 4.6 to build/play Zoo Burst.

## Building
You'll need to grab [FNA](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/FNA), build it and add it to the project's dependencies to build Zoo Burst.
Put all the native libraries in the root /Natives folder. The project will copy it to the output folder automatically.
